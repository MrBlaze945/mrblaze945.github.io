            <p>
              League of Legends continues to evolve with each patch, and Patch 25.05 is no exception. This latest update brings significant balance changes, champion adjustments, and item reworks that will impact the way players approach their matches. Whether you’re a casual player or a dedicated ranked grinder, understanding these changes is key to staying ahead of the competition.

              With tweaks to popular champions, new adjustments to the jungle, and a fresh take on some core items, this patch shakes up the meta once again. Let’s break down the biggest updates and how they affect your playstyle.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Champion Adjustments: Patch 25.05 includes several buffs and nerfs that will shift the power dynamics on the Rift. Notable changes include:
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Yasuo & Yone Buffs: Both champions have received slight buffs to their base attack speed and crit scaling, making them more consistent in extended fights. Players who enjoy high-mobility duelists will find these buffs rewarding, especially in the mid and late game.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Ahri Nerfs: The Nine-Tailed Fox has been dominating mid-lane, and Riot has adjusted her mana costs on Orb of Deception and Fox-Fire to tone down her early-game dominance. This makes Ahri players more reliant on proper mana management.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Rengar Jungle Rework: Rengar's jungle clearing speed has been improved, making him a stronger pick for early-game aggression. His passive now grants increased sustain, making his counter-jungle potential even more dangerous.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Item Changes: Several key items have been reworked to better align with their intended playstyles.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Kraken Slayer Rework: This critical-strike item now deals true damage on every third auto-attack rather than bonus physical damage. This makes it a strong pick for ADCs that rely on consistent damage output, such as Vayne and Kai’Sa.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Eclipse Adjustments: Eclipse now grants less lifesteal but provides a stronger shield when activated. This shifts the item’s focus towards burst trades rather than sustain fights.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Zhonya’s Hourglass Cost Increase: Due to its high usage across all roles, Zhonya’s active effect now has a slightly increased cooldown, and the item's total cost has been raised by 200 gold. This means mages and assassins will need to be more careful about when they activate their stasis.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Jungle Updates: The jungle has once again seen changes, impacting the way junglers control the map.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Smite Scaling Adjustments: Smite now deals more damage to jungle monsters in the early game but scales slightly lower in the late game. This encourages early objective control and faster clears but reduces the impact of full-clear junglers later on.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              - Gromp and Krugs XP Nerf: The jungle experience has been slightly reduced from these camps to discourage excessive power farming and encourage more ganking.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Visually, the patch introduces some UI updates, particularly with in-game ability cooldown tracking. The ultimate ability bar now highlights champions who are close to having their ultimates available, improving communication during team fights.
              <br><br>
              <img src="images/article-images/8-leagueoflegends-pictures/Left.jpg" alt="League of Legends Teamfight" class="float-left">
              Additionally, some minor map adjustments have been made, including better terrain visibility around key objective areas.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              How This Affects Your Playstyle: With these changes, aggressive early-game junglers will find themselves in a stronger position, while champions that rely on sustain and long trades may struggle. ADCs who use Kraken Slayer will see increased damage potential, and mid-laners who rely on Zhonya’s will need to adapt to its cost increase.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Support players should also be aware of the item adjustments, as some enchanter-focused items have received slight tweaks to better balance healing and shielding output.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Ultimately, Patch 25.05 reinforces the importance of early-game objective control and adaptability in itemisation. Players who can adjust to these changes will find themselves in a better position to climb the ranks.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Stay sharp, Summoners, and get ready for another shift in the meta!
