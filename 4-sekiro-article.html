              Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is widely regarded as one of FromSoftware’s most challenging yet rewarding titles. Unlike other Soulsborne games, which offer a variety of playstyles, Sekiro demands mastery of its parrying mechanic, known as Deflection, in order to succeed. Many players struggle with this aspect of the game, but once mastered, it transforms combat into a fluid and exhilarating dance of steel.
              <br><br>
              <img src="images/article-images/4-sekiro-pictures/Right.jpg" alt="Sekiro Parrying in Combat" class="float-right">
              So, how can you perfect the parry and turn even the toughest boss battles in your favour? Let’s break down the key techniques and strategies for mastering Sekiro’s most vital mechanic.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              The first step to improving your parry skills is understanding the importance of timing. Unlike blocking in traditional action games, Deflection in Sekiro requires precision. Pressing the block button (L1/LB) at the exact moment an enemy’s attack connects will deflect it, reducing their posture while preserving your own. Learning the attack patterns of enemies is crucial, as parrying blindly will often lead to mistimed blocks and unnecessary damage.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              A common mistake players make is spamming the parry button. While it may seem like a viable strategy in early encounters, later bosses will easily punish reckless deflections. Instead, focus on controlled, well-timed presses. Watching an enemy’s wind-up animations will help you anticipate their attacks rather than react too late.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              One of the best ways to improve parrying is by practising against weaker enemies. Early in the game, Ashina Soldiers provide an excellent training ground. Repeatedly deflecting their strikes without attacking back can help reinforce the rhythm necessary for later fights. Additionally, the Hirata Estate section offers a perfect opportunity to hone deflection skills against aggressive foes.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Understanding enemy posture is just as important as mastering deflection. Each successful parry reduces an enemy’s posture, bringing them closer to a deathblow. However, enemies with high posture recovery will regain their stance quickly unless you continue to apply pressure. Mixing parries with aggressive attacks will keep their posture bar filling, leading to quicker fights.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Boss fights in Sekiro heavily revolve around deflection. Take Genichiro Ashina, for example—his relentless sword strikes can be overwhelming at first, but recognising his attack strings and parrying them perfectly will lead to swift posture breaks.
              <br><br>
              <img src="images/article-images/4-sekiro-pictures/Left.jpg" alt="Sekiro Boss Parry" class="float-left">
              This principle applies to most bosses in the game, making parrying not just a defensive tool but an offensive strategy.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Another key element is the Mikiri Counter. While technically not a parry, this move allows you to counter thrust attacks by stepping into them rather than dodging away. Many late-game bosses use dangerous thrust attacks, and mastering the Mikiri Counter significantly increases your ability to dominate fights. Similarly, jump counters are essential for dealing with sweeping attacks, as dodging them is often unreliable.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              For those still struggling with parrying, using the practice dummy Hanbei the Undying at the Dilapidated Temple can be an invaluable resource. Spending time here refining your deflections without the risk of dying allows for a low-stress way to improve reaction times.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Sekiro’s combat is built around the philosophy of aggression. Unlike Dark Souls, where rolling and dodging are often the best tactics, Sekiro encourages players to stand their ground and meet attacks head-on. Once you fully embrace the parrying mechanic, fights that once felt impossible will become exhilarating showcases of skill and precision.
              </p>
              
              <p>
              Mastering the parry mechanic in Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice takes time, patience, and plenty of trial and error. However, once perfected, it transforms the game from a brutal struggle into a rewarding and deeply satisfying experience. So, step into the world of Ashina with confidence, and remember—steel meets steel, hesitation is defeat, and the path to victory lies in perfecting the art of deflection.
